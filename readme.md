For this analysis to work, put all subject data in a folder named exactly as follows: FIRST_LAST. For reference, look at how the raw data is named. These subject folders must go
into a subfolder so the analysis code filepath knows where to go. Additionally, the items in additional information provide the struct information for the codes, they must be in
the same folder as the analysis codes. Finally, these csv struct informations must be altered everytime a different experiment needs to be analyzed, so alter both protocol info and 
scatter info. Finally, an All folder will be created for aggregating the data. Delete this data everytime a new experiment is analyzed.
